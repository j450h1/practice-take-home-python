Sample Take Home Coding Exercise for a Data Scientist Position
Instructions
This coding exercise should be performed in python (which is the programming language used by the team). You are free to use the internet and any other libraries. Please save your work in a Jupyter notebook and email it to us for review.
Data file: cruise_ship_info.csv (this file will be emailed to you)
Objective: Build a regressor that recommends the “crew” size for potential ship buyers.
Please do the following steps (hint: use numpy, scipy, pandas, sklearn and matplotlib)
1. Read the file and display columns.
2. Calculate basic statistics of the data (count, mean, std, etc) and examine data and state your observations.
3. Select columns that will be probably important to predict “crew” size.
4. If you removed columns explain why you removed those.
5. Use one-hot encoding for categorical features.
6. Create training and testing sets (use 60% of the data for the training and reminder for testing).
7. Build a machine learning model to predict the ‘crew’ size.
8. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient for the training set and testing data sets.
9. Describe hyper-parameters in your model and how you would change them to improve the performance of the model.
10.What is regularization? What is the regularization parameter in your model?
11.Plot regularization parameter value vs Pearson correlation for the test and training sets, and see whether your model has bias problem or variance problem.
General Remarks About the Sample Take Home Exercise
The sample take home coding exercise presented here is a very straightforward problem. The dataset is clean and well structured, its a relatively small dataset, and the instructions of what to do are very clear.
Sometimes, take home coding exercises could be very complex and challenging. Whatever the case might be, you need to try your best to deliver the best solution possible.
Also if you find yourself stuck on the problem, you can always email your data science interview team, and they can provide some guidance or hints.
General Advice for Take Home Coding Exercises
The data science take home challenge exercise provides an opportunity for you to showcase your ability to work on a data science project. You need to demonstrate exceptional abilities here. For example, if you are asked to build a multi-regression model, make sure you can demonstrate a full understanding of the following advanced concepts:
(i) Feature standardization
(ii) Hyperparameter tuning
(iii) Cross-validation
(iv) Techniques of dimensionality reduction such as PCA (principal component analysis) and Lasso regression
(v) Generalization error
(vi) Uncertainty quantification
(vii) Demonstrate the ability to use advanced data science techniques such as sklearn’s pipeline tool for model building.
(viii) Be able to interpret your model in terms of real-life applications.
In summary, we’ve discussed about take home coding exercises for data scientist position. The sample coding exercise presented here is just an example. Sometimes, the take home coding exercise could be very broad, and the dataset provided could be very complex. Whatever the case might be, the take home coding exercise provides a great opportunity for a job applicant to showcase their data science skills.
